Description: Tools to create and manipulate probability
    distributions using S3.  Generics random(), pdf(), cdf() and
    quantile() provide replacements for base R's r/d/p/q style functions.
    Functions and arguments have been named carefully to minimize
    confusion for students in intro stats courses. The documentation for
    each distribution contains detailed mathematical notes.
