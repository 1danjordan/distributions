# distributions

<!-- badges: start -->

`distributions` is inspired by the eponynmous Julia package [Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl), which takes a generic function approach to probability distributions.

The key idea of `distributions` is to replace the `rnorm()`, `pnorm()`, etc, family of functions with S3 methods for distribution objects. The main generics are:

- `random()`: Draw samples from a distribution.
- `pdf()`: Evaluate the probability density of mass at a point `x`.
- `cdf()`: Evaluate the cumulative probability up to a point `x`.
- `quantile()`: Determine the quantile at `p`. Inverse of `cdf()`.

## Installation

`distributions` is not yet on CRAN. You can install the development version with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alexpghayes/distributions")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r intro}
library(distributions)

b <- bernoulli(0.1)

random(b, 10)
pdf(b, 1)
cdf(b, 0)
quantile(b, 0.5)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
