\title{Evaluate the probability density of a probability distribution}
\usage{
cdf(d, x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{A probability distribution object such as those created by
a call to [bernoulli()], [beta()], or [binomial()].}

\item{x}{A vector of elements whose cumulative probabilities you would
like to determine given the distribution `d`.}

\item{...}{Unused. Unevaluated arguments will generate a warning to
catch mispellings or other possible errors.}
}
\value{
A vector of probabilities, one for each element of `x`.
}
\description{
For discrete distributions, the probabilty mass function.
